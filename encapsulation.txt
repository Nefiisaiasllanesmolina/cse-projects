What is encapsulation and why is it important?

Encapsulation is enclosing content inside a capsule. In this
case, in programming it means that the classes of my program
should only have access to the information that is clearly
necessary and should not access information from other classes,
they should communicate only through functions.

A benefit of encapsulation is that if the code does not work
as expected it is easier to find where the error is and correct
it.

An application of encapsulation is when we call a function of
one class from another class and by neccessity my data type
changes from a string to a list to be able to call that 
function that has changed I need to modify my other class to
be able to correctly call that function that has changed. 
This is where the concept of encapsulation comes in.

A good practice of encapsulation is when we set as private
attribute of one class:

public class Person
{
    private string _title;
    private string _firstName;
    private string _lastName;
}
