What is polymorphism and why is it important?

Polymorphism is the ability of a line of code to have different
functions depending on the context.


Highlight a benefit of Polymorphism.
Provide an application of Polymorphism.
Use a code example of Polymorphism from the program you wrote. (You should copy and paste a few lines of code that demonstrate the use of the principle.)
Thoroughly explain these concepts. (This likely cannot be done in less than 100 words.)
