What is version control and why is it important?

They are software tools in which we can save different
versions of code made over time. Some advantages are that we 
can fix bugs in the code without affecting the code
main until we have found the solution. Another advantage
is that it facilitates teamwork, since each member of the team
computer has a copy of the code and can make changes to it
without affecting the work of others. The most version control
common is Git, it can link to your code editor and perform
changes to the source code. The command to start a repository
in Git it is git init, this command starts the repository to get started 
to manage your versions of source code.
