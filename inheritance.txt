What is inheritance and why is it important?
Your response must:

Explain the meaning of Inheritance.
Highlight a benefit of Inheritance.
Provide an application of Inheritance.
Use a code example of Inheritance from the program you wrote. (You should copy and paste a few lines of code that demonstrate the use of the principle.)
Thoroughly explain these concepts. (This likely cannot be done in less than 100 words.)
