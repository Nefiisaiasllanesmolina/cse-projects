What is inheritance and why is it important?

Inheritance is the ability to obtain attributes and methods
from other classes directly. even without writing them.

One benefit of inheritance is that you can assign the same
method to different classes and avoid rewriting the same
code multiple times.

An example I learned this week is about a class called Person
and a class called Employee, both share the Name method but 
the employee can carry other additional methods.

public class Person{
    public string GetName()
    {
        return "Nefi";
    }
}

public class Employee : Person{
    public string GetPosition()
    {
        return "Manager";
    }
}

Student student = new Student();
string name = student.GetPosition();
Console.WriteLine(name);

In this case, the Person class is known as a parent class.
The Employee class is known as a child class and both shared
the GetName method but Employee class has more methods.
