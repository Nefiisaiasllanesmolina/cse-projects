What is abstraction and why is it important?

Abstraction is the process to simplificate the complex ideas 
into simple ones, conservating only the essential elements. 
A benefit of abstraction is that we can use complex functions
in a simple way . Also our code will be more clear to understand
and use it.
One example of abstraction is when we use functions, and we
reuse the functions we are using abstraction in this way. Also
languages like Python use default functions that requires
many lines of code to use them.
Also this is an example of abstraction:

foreach (Job job in _jobs)
        {
            job.Display();
        }

We are simplifying the loop process in few lines of code.
